# EEG_Based_BCI
In this project we are taking a persons EEG which are generated in brain and use them to make the person able to interface with any system.
Here we are preprocessing the EEG signals collected, and use a derivative of CNN to process and give us the predicted output.
This predicted output is used to interface any system by the person.
We have demonstrated a proteius circuit to take the predicted output, and interface or give us the desired output.
